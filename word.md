This page gives the word cloud for the dataset which has the different factors, conditions that are causing the accidents to take place. 

A `Wordcloud` is a very fun but effective way of highlighting the relative frequency of words in a text. 

The `larger the word` in the visual the `more common the word` was in the dataset.
It can also be used for communicating the most salient points or themes in the reporting stage. 

In our dataset for road accidents in Australia, the most commonly used word is **`fine`** followed by **`collision`**. 

_When hovered over the text/ words in the wordcloud, the frequency of words used is displayed_

**This bar plot shows the relation between the condition of the roads during the accidents and the number of accidents.**

- It is to be noted that the record for road condition is not given, hence the values are null/NA.

- In the state of `Queensland`, the number of cases are `more` when the roads are sealed.

- Very few times the cases are recorded for when the roads are wet due to the rains.

- The same analysis goes for the state of `South Australia` as well.
